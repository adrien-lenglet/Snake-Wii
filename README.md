## Background [added context from Adrien LENGLET, 31st of August, 2023]

This is mostly a playground homebrew I wrote, based off the game engine my colleagues & I wrote in college at the time https://github.com/Sangliers-Feroces/Vega-Engine  
The renderer was rewritten of course, as the Dolphin architecture uses a fixed pipeline so modern OpenGL couldn't be ported as is.  
Other than that, this is a 3D snake with the same texture for everything. It was fun learning about Dolphin programming in couple of days! I would like to get back to homebrew programming and work on state-of-the art renderers someday.
